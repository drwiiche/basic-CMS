### This a simple Content Management System **\(CMS\)**
###### I build this CMS using PHP and MySQLi and implementing a ton of great options that php offers such as :

* Create a database
* Connect to a database
* Apply the CRUD \( Create, Read, Update and Delete\)
* The use of Sessions and cookies
* Basic Authentication System
